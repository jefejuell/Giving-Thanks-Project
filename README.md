# Giving Thanks App Project
<a href="https://jefejuell.github.io/Giving-Thanks-Project/"><b>Giving Thanks Project</b></a>

### **Description:**  
Giving Thanks (GivTks) is an app/website project that was envisioned to help people embrace gratitude as a way to find peace, happiness, and joy.  It encourages people to express gratitude in various ways.  The home page invites people to make a gratitude list along with corresponding reasons for that gratitude.  A new inspiring quote is displayed upon a button click, where students can "favorite" (and remove) the ones they like. The Giving Back page has a comment section where users can post comments, along with editing and deleting them.  There are also ideas about ways to express gratitude, including places to volunteer and signing up for a 7-day gratitude challenge.  The Building Bridges page has ideas and links to Pen Pals, exploring the world and understanding other people and their cultures.
